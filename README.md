### Issue 02 - Stop If Crash Watchdog
Streaming release date: 13/01/2024 <br>

Youtube page: https://youtu.be/fLkRN2xnHXY?si=DeNB-EbN8AmZp_JL <br>

In this issue I present my project "Stop If Crash", a simple Watchdog circuit based on IC NE555.
We will see together a simulation of the circuit, the design of the PCB with Kicad, the assembly with the functional test in the laboratory.<br>

### Issue 03 - OpticalShow
Streaming release date: 30/01/2024 <br>

Youtube page: https://youtu.be/mVdG0zdTeCE?si=hjvFPSwVRxgswea1 <br>

OpticalShow is a system that uses optical fibers to transmit the light emitted by an RGB LED matrix.
Each fiber is associated with its own LED and allows you to remote its RGB light to animate projects, such as panels, maps, artistic objects and wearables.
in this issue, in addition to describing the OpticalShow system, I show two application examples: "The world is mine!", a map of the world animated and illuminated by optical fibers and "Gloween Show" a small panel used in the Halloween party.<br>

### Issue 04 - CNC PCB milling
Streaming release date: 13/02/2024 <br>

Youtube page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61v8TkvMFBA <br>
Make PCB with CNC milling machine <br>
In this issue I present to you my economical CNC milling machine Vevor CNC 3018 PRO, with which I started making PCBs for my simplest projects.
In addition to describing the milling machine, we will create a small step by step project together, from the CAD drawing of the PCB to the milling!<br>

If you also want to practice with the same PCB shown in the video, you can download all the CAD, CAM and CNC files from the following link:<br>

### Issue 05 - EV Lithium upgrades
Streaming release date: 27/02/2024 <br>

Youtube page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmhK0d0eKHg <br>
In this issue I take a trip back in time to tell you about my projects related to electric mobility.
Today there is a lot of talk about electric mobility.
I started to be interested in 2-wheeled electric vehicles in 2013, so I could go to work every day while polluting less!
I gave life back to 3 electric motorbikes that had exhausted batteries, transforming them into high-performance vehicles, with lithium batteries!
The vehicles I upgraded are:
E-tropolis Belair,
Vectrix Vx1 and e-max 110s

I have decided to share with you this exciting experience that lasted 10 years.

I have shared the documents of my upgrades at the following links:
